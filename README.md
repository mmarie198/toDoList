# toDoList
A 'To Do List' web application that is connected to the ATDAPI service. 
Created using HTML/CSS and JS.
Design features are kept minimal as focus will mostly be kept on building the API.
This contains a list of tasks rendered in the DOM based on data from the ATDAPI server.
Each task has a description, a remove button, and a mark complete/active button.
Also contains an input element and a button that lets user add a new task.
This has persistent data so changes made on the application will be reflected after the program is closed.
